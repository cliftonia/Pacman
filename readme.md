## Technologies

- Ruby
- MiniTest & MiniTest Reporters

## Approach

- My first task was to right myself down a checklist of how I wanted to solve this challange.
- I used Ruby because I have done previous challanges similiar to this one and found it great for storing input
- I used a class for pacman because I then would be able to write unit tests.
- I decided to go with using a Hash/Object as I was storing properties for pacman
- Then I started to create my methods and write tests for them
- Once i was happy with them all working the way they were supposed to, I then started taking the inputs
- I used loops for error handling for when the user tried to type outside the scope of the game
- Lastly I wanted to change it up a little and at the beginning ask the user to provide an X coordinate and a Y coordinate and lastly ask them what direction they would like to face.

## Challenges & lessons learnt

- Take your time to really thing about the data types you will use

## Still to do...

- I really enjoyed this challange and would love to make it more graphically appealing
